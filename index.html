                    <h2>Lajes Field, Azores, Portugal</h2>
                    <p>My first assignment was quite a surprise. 
                    The Azores is an archipelago of nine islands located in the north Atlantic
                    ocean off the coast of Portugal.</p>

                    <a name="McGuire AFB"></a>
                    <h2>McGuire AFB Wrightstown, NJ</h2>
                    <p>Next stop landed me on the East Coast in the small town of Wrightstown, NJ.
                    Although I was assigned at McGuire AFB, I spent most of my time on the road. 
                    I was a Contingency Communications Radio Operator which meant where there was
                    a war or possible contingency, my unit was there.  Of course, back in the '90s
                    they claim women didn't go to war.</p>

                    <a name="Anderson"></a>
                    <h2>Anderson AFB Guam</h2>
                    <p>Guam was one of my favorite assignments.  I gave birth to my first daughter
                    and I had lots of fun on the beach.  I also survived an 8.1 earthquake that
                    was very devastating to the island infrastructure.</p>

                    <a name="Scott AFB"></a>
                    <h2>Scott AFB Belleville, IL</h2>
                    <p>At Scott AFB I began my 8 year recruiting career.  Recruiting is a very
                    challenging but fulfilling position to have in the Air Force, at least if 
                    you're successful.  I recruited young high schoolers for military service.  
                    After 3 years of recruiting for our enlisted forces, I was tasked to recruit
                    college graduates to include pilots and engineers.</p>

                    <a name="National Guard"></a>
                    <h2>National Guard Bureau Crystal City, VA</h2>
                    <p>This is where I started my career as an Air Force Officer.  I was assigned
                    as a Management Analyst at the Guard Bureau where I was very instrumental 
                    in the decision making process when determing the strength of each Air National
                    Guard organization.  This was a great learning experience which certainly came 
                    with some challenges.</p>

                    <a name="The Pentagon"></a>
                    <h2>The Pentagon Arlington, VA</h2>
                    <p>At the Pentagon I worked as a Manpower Officer in Logistics.  This was only a 1 year
                        assignment but very enlightening to say the least.  I had the opportunity to work with
                        some very smart and influential government civilian employees.  This was my first 
                        experience with working in the Logistics community.</p>

                    <h2>Ali Al Salem Air Base Kuwait City, Kuwait</h2>
                    <p>My deployment to Kuwait was my final adventure in the Air Force.  In Kuwait I worked
                        as a Protocal Officer.  I met many dignitaries and celebrities during this tour.  Although
                        being a Protocal Officer is hard work, it's also very rewarding.  It feels good to see
                        the troops take some time out to relax and enjoy the entertainment.  This was a great way
                        to wrap up a 27 year Air Force career.</p>
